Instructions for Creating a Quartus II Project for mips32r1 Wishbone SoC
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the HDL source files for the MIPS32 processor and SoC
as well as scripts to create and build the SoC using Altera's Quartus II
software.

  make_project.sh                    : Creates the project (uses files from scripts/)
  scripts/Makefile.template          : An incomplete project Makefile

  src/                               : Processor and SoC HDL source files
  src/LIST                           : An list of common SoC HDL source files
  boards/<board name>                : Board-specific files
  boards/<board name>/LIST           : An list of board-specific source files
  boards/<board name>/settings.tcl   : Project settings and constraints


Requirements
------------

- You must have Altera's Quartus II software on your system (tested with 13.1 and 15.0).
- Your path must include the Quartus II binaries. For example, if Quartus II
  is installed in /opt/altera/13.1, then your path should include
  /opt/altera/13.1/quartus/bin32 (or bin64, or bin). If you can run "quartus_sh" from
  your command prompt, then you should be ready.
- The scripts require make as well as a few standard Unix utilities
  such as readlink, sed, and rm.


Procedure
---------

Make sure you've read the Requirements section above!

1. Create the project
    ./make_project.sh <board name> [<project dir>]

2. Change into the project directory (default is "proj")
    cd proj

3. Build the project (create sof-file)
    make

4. Build svf-file if necessary
    make mips32r1-soc.svf
